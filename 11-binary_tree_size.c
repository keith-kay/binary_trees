/**
 * binary_tree_size - Measures the size of a binary tree.
 * @tree: A pointer to the root node of the tree to measure the size of.
 *
 * Return: The size of the tree.
 *
 * Description: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.
 *              The function recursively calculates the size by incrementing a counter
 *              for each node encountered, including the current node and its children.
